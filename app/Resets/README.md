# 🚀  Astro — Resets

Common CSS resets in a configurable Astro component.  
Only needed CSS is injected into critical path.

All settings are applied by default. Individual rule can be disabled.

## 📦  Installation

```sh
pnpm i @julian_cataldo/astro-resets
```

## 🛠  Usage

```astro
---
import Resets from '@julian_cataldo/astro-resets/Resets.astro';
// ...
---
```

```astro
<!-- … -->
<head>
  <!-- place component inside HEAD tag -->

  <Resets
    bodyMargin={true}
    fontSmoothing={true}
    fontSystem={true}
    scrollSmooth={true}
    borderBox={true}
    svg={true}
    scrollBarKeep={true}
  />

  <!-- … -->
</head>
<!-- … -->
```

# Suggestions

It is assumed that CSS resetting is an highly opinionated topic.  
This component takes these stances about it:

- Must not aggressively override beneficial defaults
- Must make user experience better
- Must avoid side-effects
- Must be clear about what is affected
- Might be used to level-out browser inconsistencies
- Might be used to offer next gen. features
- Should be used in last resort
- Must be re-evaluated / removed regularly while browsers evolve

That being said, **don't hesitate to share your handy little resets**
in issues.

# 👨‍🏭  TypeScript API

```ts
/** All defaults: true */
export interface Props {
  /** Removes body margin */
  bodyMargin?: boolean;
  /** Coherent font smoothing */
  fontSmoothing?: boolean;
  /** Ensure system font as default fallback */
  fontSystem?: boolean;
  /** Default to native smooth scrolling */
  scrollSmooth?: boolean;
  /** Better box handling */
  borderBox?: boolean;
  /** Show scrollbar consistently, avoiding layout shifts */
  scrollBarKeep?: boolean;
}
```

# Rules

## Body margin

Removes body margin.

## Font smoothing

Cross-browser grayscale font-smoothing.

## Font system

Apply default system font instead of Times, before loading custom web-font or keeped as is.

## Scroll smooth

Ensure smooth CSS scrolling.  
Native only, no polyfill for older Safari etc.

## Border box

Consistent border box for all elements.

<!-- ## Svg

Maximize canvas.
Set color as default text color. -->

## Scroll bar keep

Always show browser scrollbar.  
This is to prevent annoying layout jump when you navigate to a page which
doesn't scroll, or when you open a lightbox/modal etc.
