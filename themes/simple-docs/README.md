# Simple-Docs

An off-the-shelf theme for development projects.

- Conventions based
- Auto content sourcing

It comes as an integration that means:

- Updatable
- Everything is out-sourced, except your content
- Ultra minimal boilerplate
- Customizable styles

> **Warning**  
> Not for production! It's **not generic enough** for now.  
> It's being used for various projects of mine, so it will benefit from that.
